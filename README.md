Welcome to my GitHub profile, I don't do a lot of open source stuff, but you can find everything that is open source can be found [here](https://github.com/PassTheWessel?tab=repositories&q=&type=public).<br/>
I'm currently in the process of learning [rust](https://rust-lang.org). Almost all of my open source projects are JS, but I know some other languages too. I also love animals <br/>
